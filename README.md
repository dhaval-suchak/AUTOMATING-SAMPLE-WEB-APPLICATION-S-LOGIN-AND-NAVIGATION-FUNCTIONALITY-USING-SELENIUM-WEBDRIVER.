Task 1 involves automating the testing of a sample web application's login and navigation functionality using Selenium WebDriver. The goal is to develop an automated test suite that verifies whether the applicationâ€™s login process works correctly with both valid and invalid credentials, and that users are redirected to the appropriate pages upon successful login. Additionally, the script should validate key navigation flows across the application, such as accessing the dashboard. The project requires the creation of a structured script repository using Selenium WebDriver.
